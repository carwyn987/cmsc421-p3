# University of Maryland - CMSC 421 - Intro to AI - Programming Assignment #3: Filtering

In this programming assignment, you will localize a car in a racetrack, and analyze a competitive
situation on the racetrack and its effects on successfully overtaking an opponent, avoiding collision,
and winning a race. In order to localize the car, you will create a particle filter (and a Kalman
filter for extra credit), and in order to analyze situations, you will implement a Bayesian network
to model conditional dependencies between situations and outcomes. We will then ask you some
questions about your implementations and performance.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
E.g.
```
git clone git@github.com:carwyn987/cmsc421-p3.git
```

2. Set up environment
Ideally in a virtual/conda environment
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Verify functionality
```
python3 gui.py
```
A window called "simulator.py" should open. You should see a blue car at the bottom, and it should move according to your keyboard inputs (arrow keys).

_The setup has been tested on python 3.8 and python 3.13. If you learn that a specific version of python and/or library dependencies has issues, please let us know._
